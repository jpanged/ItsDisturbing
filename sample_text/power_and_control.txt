This phase is called the Hearts and flowers stage. As the relationship deepens, this

loving attention then becomes extreme. The

perpetrator convinces the victim to spend time alone

and away from friends and family until the victim

has no support system.


The next phase is called the Tension

Building stage.

In this stage, anxiety increases when the

perpetrator begins to feel life or the relationship

getting out of control.

Typically, during this stage, the victim tries to calm

the perpetrator by becoming more nurturing,

compliant, either anticipating their every whim or

staying out of their way.

As the tension builds, it is more difficult to make the

coping techniques work, so the victim may withdraw

while the perpetratorâ€™s control increases and the

tension becomes intolerable.

While there may not be physical violence (or at least

physical violence is minimal), there is usually

emotional abuse, intimidation, and threats during

this stage.



As the tension increases, the Acute

Incident stage begins. This is the actual violent

episode. It includes physical, emotional or sexual

abuse. A crime is committed. The victim is helpless

and feels trapped.

After an acute incident the behaviors return to the

hearts and flowers stage. The abusive partner may

display kind and loving behavior. They may be

remorseful, seek forgiveness, and say it will never

happen again. The victim is worn down, and wants

to have hope that things will change. The abusive

partner may be very charming and give gifts to the

victim. This stage may last hours, days or weeks,

until the tension starts to build again, and the cycle

repeats itself.
