I Wanted To Maybe Hold One
Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life’s problems
I’m too sad to walk. Just give me a few… hours.
Okay… I’m positive that you’ll get lost in there!
Yeah, it was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sorry, I went sad again, didn’t I?
Remember the funny movie where the dog died?
Goodbye Friendship! Hello Loneliness!
Oh, he doesn’t love us anymore. That’s sad. I-I should drive, right?
