# It's Disturbing
## Is it?

## Description
Here in the United States, studies show that 10-35% of the population will exhibit domestic violence on their partners, 
yet less than 1% of domestic violence cases are ever reported to police. This is a result of many different factors,
as victims are often in love with, have an intense fear of, or may be financially dependent
on the abuser. Some victims do not even view their current situation as a physically abusive relationship, keeping them stuck 
in that unhealthy lifestyle for years.

Our project "It's Disturbing", uses Watson's Speech and Text analysis API to detect potential cases of physical and verbal abuse, and generate a report to potentially be sent out to doctors, lawyers, specified trusted friends, health centers, or the police.

### Tone Analyzer
Watson's Tone Analyzer tool helps people understand tone along three major categories: emotional, social, and language.

### Emotion
Emotional tone measures different types of emotions and feelings that people express.

####    Joy
    Joy or happiness has shades of enjoyment, satisfaction and pleasure.
    There is a sense of well-being, inner peace, love, safety and contentment.

####    Fear
    A response to impending danger.
    It is a survival mechanism that is a reaction to some negative stimulus.
    It may be a mild caution or an extreme phobia.
    
####    Sadness
    Indicates a feeling of loss and disadvantage.
    When a person can be observed to be quiet, less energetic and withdrawn.
    It may be inferred that sadness exists.
    
####    Disgust
    An emotional response of revulsion to something considered offensive or unpleasant.
    It is a sensation that refers to something revolting.
    
####    Anger
      Evoked due to injustice, conflict, humiliation, negligence or betrayal.
      If anger is active, the individual attacks the target, verbally or physically.
      If anger is passive, the person silently sulks and feels tension and hostility.
