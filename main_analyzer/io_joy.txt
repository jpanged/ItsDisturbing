Do you ever look at someone and wonder, what is going on inside their head?
Isn’t this fun?
You remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was colouring? I could listen to her stories, all day. I just wanted Riley to be happy…
But the really important ones are here. I don’t want to get too technical but these are called Core Memories. Each one came from a super important time in Riley’s life, like when she first scored a goal. That was so amazing!
This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned, physically and socially.
Think positive!
Come on, group hug! You too, Anger.
These are Riley’s memories, and they’re mostly happy if you notice. Not to brag.
Oh, it’s that time in the twisty tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mom and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. It’s my favorite.
Hey, look! The golden gate bridge! Isn’t that great? It’s not made out of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment, but still!
It was amazing! Just Riley and me, forever. Um, for thirty-three seconds.
Well, I have to practice! And I don’t think of it so much as playing more so as “hugging”! Okay! First day of school! Very very exciting! I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. Here it is!
Joy! You’ll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long! And did I mention I love your dress, its adorable?
