I just can’t help thinking that if it wasn’t for me, Susan will still be

alive right now. I just can’t live with the guilt.

I just can’t live with this guilt. Everyone is looking at me. They know

that I had broken up with Susan. No one, except you, will talk to me.

I’m sure everyone hates me and wishes I were dead. I might as well

do them a favor.

Yes, I was planning to get drunk and drive off the bridge tonight.

I was thinking about going to my old therapist, but I don’t even know

if she is still around. It has been over a year since I last saw her.
